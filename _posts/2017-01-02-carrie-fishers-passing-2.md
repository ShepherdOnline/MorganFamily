I found it to be somewhat fitting, and a little ironic, that I learned about Carrie Fisher’s death just a few minutes after watching “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.” She had been in the hospital since before Christmas, and the reports that I had read before going into the movie didn’t sound very good. So, perhaps it didn’t come as a complete surprise, but it was still a shock.

When I was a boy, I gravitated more towards the characters of Han Solo or Luke Skywalker than Princess Leia, but as I’ve been thinking back it has occurred to me that I’ve always respected the character as much as the others. While the 1977 movie “Star Wars” centered around “saving the princess,” Princess Leia was still someone who could hold her own, and I always loved how she ended up bossing Han Solo around shortly after she was rescued and they had saved themselves from being crushed to death in the garbage compactor. She always struck me as being a little wiser than the other characters because she automatically knew what was what, while Luke and Han were basically making things up as they went along.

Another vignette I have that relates to Carrie Fisher/Princess Leia, is that during our wedding ceremony I told my wife that she looked like Princess Leia in her dress. This was a commentary as to how beautiful she looked, but it was also a measurement of her character--strong and resourceful, much like Princess Leia.

And yesterday, Carrie’s mom passed away. I can’t imagine the weight the others in the feel from losing both a mother and a sister.
