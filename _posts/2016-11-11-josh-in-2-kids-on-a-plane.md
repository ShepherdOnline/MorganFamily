Eight years ago, I edited together footage I shot of Josh and my nephew, Alex, inside the "History of Airplanes" exhibit at the Henry Ford museum. Everything was improvised, and I wasn't planning on doing anything with the video once I was home. But, after I was home and played this portion of the tape I realized that I could edited together the scenes and make this into a quick movie.

The general idea of the video is that perhaps these two boys were the last ones on the jet airliner. Unsupervised, they were playing around in the cabin of the jet. I had originally planned on using toy jets to create establishing shots of the fictional airplane they were in, but eventually ended up splicing in footage of jets I found on the Internet. For the climactic ending, I edited in footage of a a jet engine which was on fire. There is a URL that's shown on top of that part of the video, but at the time it was so late at night that I decided to use the footage.

I feel a little bad about ending the video with the jet crashing. The last we see is the boys clinging to the side of the jet as it supposedly goes down. My theory is that they survived by letting go at the right moment, and were far enough from the jet when it crashed to be okay.

This video is important to me because it reminds me of the time we spent together as a family at Greenfield Village, and it is a moment I shared with my son and my nephew. They seemed to have a lot of fun playing inside that exhibit, and it was an interesting challenge taking what they did and molding it into a YouTube video.

We watched the video again last weekend after it popped up in one of my YouTube searches. My youngest son, Elijah, was mesmerized by it. Josh asked me if there as a chance that we could make a sequel. I told him that it couldn't be "2 Kids on a Plane," because we have very few kids now among all of the nieces and nephews. Perhaps if there was a sequel, it might star Josh and Alex as grown-up airplane pilots.
